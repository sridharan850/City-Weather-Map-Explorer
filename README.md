WeatherMap Explorer is a modern, responsive web application that combines real-time weather forecasting with live map visualization for any city around the globe. Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, this app enhances the user experience by displaying current weather data, a city map, and optional traffic information — all in one intuitive interface.

The core idea is to provide users with a one-stop platform to:

🔍 Search for any city

🌤️ Instantly view weather information (temperature, humidity, condition)

🗺️ Visualize the city's location on Google Maps

🚦 (Advanced) Check real-time traffic conditions (optional)
